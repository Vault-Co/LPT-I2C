# LPT-I2C
Parallel Port  Routines for I2C Bitbanging

Originally written for Turbo-C, then ported to MSC and WATCOM

These routines would be very useful if they were written to
work against the new CNC USB Breakout Boards with LPT outputs so that
an I2C library would run on all devices from DOS up to Win10.

Putting them here as an initial version intended for improvement.
